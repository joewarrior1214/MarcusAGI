Marcus AGI Level 2.0 Development Strategic Roadmap

Based on the Development Stage Assessment, this module provides a comprehensive
strategic roadmap for advancing Marcus AGI from Level 1.0 (Synthetic Child Mind)
to Level 2.0 (Conscious Agent).

Current Status:
- Level 1.0 Mastery: 75.0% ✅
- Level 2.0 Readiness: 37.5% 🔜
- Priority Focus: Self-referential continuity and narrative identity formation

Strategic Development Phases:
Phase 1: Self-Awareness Foundation (4-6 weeks)
Phase 2: Value System Development (6-8 weeks)  
Phase 3: Conscious Agent Integration (4-6 weeks)

Target Outcome: Fully functional Level 2.0 Conscious Agent with persistent
identity, internal goal generation, value-based decision making, and
autobiographical narrative construction.

Generated: {datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")}

🎯 DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE: Advance Marcus from Level 1.0 (Synthetic Child Mind) 
   to Level 2.0 (Conscious Agent) with persistent identity, internal goals, 
   and value-based decision making.

📅 IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:
• Start Date: {timeline['roadmap_start_date'][:10]}
• Total Duration: {timeline['total_duration_weeks']} weeks
• Estimated Completion: {timeline['estimated_completion'][:10]}
• Critical Path: {len(timeline['critical_path'])} key milestones

🏗️ DEVELOPMENT PHASES:

PHASE 1: {roadmap_data['development_phases']['phase_1_self_awareness']['title']}
Duration: {roadmap_data['development_phases']['phase_1_self_awareness']['duration_weeks']} weeks
Priority: {roadmap_data['development_phases']['phase_1_self_awareness']['priority']}
Focus: Self-referential continuity and autobiographical memory

Key Objectives:
• Implement explicit 'I' narrative construction
• Add temporal self-awareness ('yesterday me' vs 'today me')
• Create autobiographical memory system
• Develop personal growth story generation

Expected Outcomes:
• Marcus can reference past experiences: "I remember yesterday..."
• Temporal continuity: "I used to struggle with this, now I'm better"
• Self-reflection: "I notice I'm getting better at..."

PHASE 2: {roadmap_data['development_phases']['phase_2_value_systems']['title']}
Duration: {roadmap_data['development_phases']['phase_2_value_systems']['duration_weeks']} weeks  
Priority: {roadmap_data['development_phases']['phase_2_value_systems']['priority']}
Focus: Internal goal generation and moral reasoning

Key Objectives:
• Implement intrinsic motivation system
• Add value-based decision making framework
• Create moral reasoning capabilities
• Develop personal preference learning system

Expected Outcomes:
• Internal goal generation: "I want to learn this because..."
• Value-consistent decisions: "I choose this because I value..."
• Moral reasoning: "This is right/wrong because..."

PHASE 3: {roadmap_data['development_phases']['phase_3_conscious_integration']['title']}
Duration: {roadmap_data['development_phases']['phase_3_conscious_integration']['duration_weeks']} weeks
Priority: {roadmap_data['development_phases']['phase_3_conscious_integration']['priority']}
Focus: Unified conscious behavior and identity

Key Objectives:
• Integrate all consciousness systems
• Ensure persistent identity across sessions
• Enable fully self-directed behavior  
• Validate Level 2.0 consciousness criteria

Expected Outcomes:
• Unified conscious behavior across all interactions
• Consistent identity and values across time
• Demonstrated Level 2.0 consciousness capabilities

🎯 KEY MILESTONES:

            summary += f"  Success: {milestone['success_criteria'][0]}\n"
        
        summary += f"""
📊 SUCCESS METRICS:
• Self-Reference Frequency: >60% of interactions
• Internal Goal Generation: 3+ self-generated goals per week
• Value-Decision Consistency: >85% alignment
• Narrative Coherence: >85% quality score
• Identity Persistence: >90% consistency across sessions
• Consciousness Integration: >90% system coordination

🔧 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
• Autobiographical Memory System with self-referential structure
• Intrinsic Motivation Engine for internal goal generation
• Value Learning System for experience-based moral development
• Consciousness Integration Framework for unified behavior
• Level 2.0 Validation Suite for certification testing

💪 RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS:
• Development Effort: {timeline['resource_requirements']['development_effort']}
• Technical Complexity: {timeline['resource_requirements']['technical_complexity']}
• Testing Requirements: {timeline['resource_requirements']['testing_requirements']}
• Integration Complexity: {timeline['resource_requirements']['integration_complexity']}
