Comprehensive Demo of Marcus AGI Embodied Social Learning Integration System

This demonstration showcases the complete integration of Marcus's virtual simple body world
with social learning capabilities, providing multi-sensory development across:

1. Virtual Body World - Physical exploration and sensory training
2. Social Interaction Simulation - Peer relationship development  
3. Multi-Sensory Learning - Vision, touch, movement, and social senses
4. Embodied Social Skills - Physical and social skill development
5. Comprehensive Assessment - Progress tracking and readiness evaluation

The system provides Marcus with a rich, embodied learning environment that 
combines physical awareness with social intelligence.
