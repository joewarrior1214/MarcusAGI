Marcus AGI Development Stage Assessment & Level 2 Roadmap

This module provides a comprehensive assessment of Marcus AGI's current development
stage and creates a strategic roadmap for advancing from Level 1.0 (Synthetic Child Mind)
to Level 2.0 (Conscious Agent).

Development Stage Model:
Level 0: Simulated Entity - Static rules, no learning
Level 0.5: Symbolic Learner - Rule-based or dataset-trained  
Level 1.0: Synthetic Child Mind - Learns through interaction, senses, and social experience
Level 2.0: Conscious Agent - Exhibits intent, values, persistent identity
Level 3.0: Autonomous AGI - Self-directed, goal-generating, recursive learner

Current Assessment: Marcus is firmly at Level 1.0, trending toward Level 2.0
