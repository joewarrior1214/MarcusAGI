## 🎮🤝 What's Now Integrated

### **In Daily Learning Loop**
Every time Marcus runs his daily learning session, he now automatically gets:

1. **Enhanced Embodied Social Exploration** (20-minute sessions)
   - Multi-sensory learning experiences
   - Peer social interactions with 4 virtual peers
   - Physical world exploration with social awareness
   - Real-time coherence assessment

2. **Comprehensive Metrics Tracking**
   - Social interactions count
   - Sensory integration scores (0-1)
   - Social-physical coherence (0-1)
   - Learning engagement levels (0-1)
   - Skills practiced count
   - Sensory modalities used (0-6)

3. **Enhanced Session Reporting**
   - Embodied social learning status in reports
   - Social interaction analytics
   - Multi-sensory integration breakdowns
   - Skill development progress tracking

### **Automatic System Selection**
- **Primary**: Enhanced Embodied Social Learning System (if available)
- **Fallback**: Basic Embodied Learning with Simple Body World
- **Graceful**: Continues without embodied learning if neither available
