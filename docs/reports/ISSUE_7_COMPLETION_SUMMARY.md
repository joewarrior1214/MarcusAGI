## ðŸ“Š Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Grade progression tracking
grade_progressions (id, student_id, from_grade, to_grade, progression_date, readiness_score, assessment_data)

-- Current status tracking  
current_grade_status (student_id, current_grade, grade_entry_date, days_in_grade, subject_mastery_levels)

-- Subject mastery tracking
subject_mastery_tracking (id, student_id, grade_level, subject, concept_id, mastery_level, assessment_date)
```

### System Integration
- **Memory System**: Stores learning concepts and mastery data
- **EQ Assessment**: Evaluates social-emotional readiness
- **Curriculum System**: Provides grade-appropriate content
- **Factory Pattern**: Easy system instantiation and configuration

## ðŸš€ Demo Results
